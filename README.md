# Requirements

 * iOS 10.0+
 * Xcode 10.1+
 * Swift 4.2+

# Installation

## CocoaPods

[CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/) is a dependency manager for Cocoa projects. You can install it with the following command:

    $ gem install cocoapods

To integrate InPlayerSDK into your Xcode project using CocoaPods, specify it in your `Podfile`

    source 'https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git'
    install! 'cocoapods',
         : preserve_pod_file_structure => true
    platform :ios, '10.0'

    target '<Your Target name>' do
        use_frameworks!
        pod 'InPlayerSDK'
    end

Then, run the following command:

    $ pod install

**Note**: InPlayerSDK is build with submodules. So if you like you can add it like this in your Podfile:

    pod 'InPlayerSDK' (all features, default)
    pod 'InPlayerSDK/Core' (includes Core features - Account, Asset, Subscription)
    pod 'InPlayerSDK/Payment' (includes Core and Payment modules)
    pod 'InPlayerSDK/Notification' (includes Core and Notification modules)

## Dependencies

This SDK has dependencies that it relies on. The list consists of:

     pod 'Alamofire', '5.2.0'
     pod 'AWSIoT', '2.13.4' (only Notifications module)

## Usage

 Import `InPlayerSDK` to your file.

### Configuration

To intialize SDK and start using it, you must first do the following steps:

Create configuration object:

     let configuration = InPlayer.Configuration(clientId: "<YOUR CLIENT ID HERE>", referrer: "<REFERRER URL GOES HERE>" environment: <ENVIORMENT TYPE>)

Initialize InPlayer:

    InPlayer.initialize(configuration: configuration)

### Services

InPlayerSDK consists out of five services:
`Account`, `Asset`, `Payment`, `Subscription` and `Notification`.

##### Account
Account related methods.

###### Example
Authenticate method:

    InPlayer.Account.authenticate(username: "<YOUR USERNAME>", password: "<YOUR PASSWORD>", success: { (authorization) in
        // Successfully logged in.
    }, failure: { (error) in
        // Some error occured.
    })

##### Asset
Asset related methods:

###### Example
Get asset details:

    InPlayer.Asset.getAsset(id: <ITEM_ID>, success: { (item) in
       // Successfully obtained item details.
    }, failure: { error in
       // Some error occured.
    }

Check asset access:

    InPlayer.Asset.checkAccessForAsset(id: <ITEM_ID>), success: { (itemAccess) in
        // You have access to this asset
    }, failure: { (error) in
        // Some error occured.            
    })

Additionally when checking access for asset, in `itemAccess.item` there is `content` that can be plain string or json string. In order to parse the model accordingly and have access to its properties (every type has different properties), we encorage you to use it in this matter while in `success` block:

    if let ContentType.accedo(asset) = itemAccess.item.parseContent() {
        // Parsed content is of type `accedo`, and the `asset` is the resource you can use it
    }

##### Payment
Payment related methods:

###### Example
Validate purchase:

    InPlayer.Payment.validate(receiptString: <RECEIPT_STRING>, productIdentifier: <PRODUCT_IDENTIFIER>, success: {
        // Successfully validated receipt
    }, failure: { (error) in
        // Some error occured
    })

##### Subscription
Subscription related methods:

###### Example
Get account subscriptions: 

    InPlayer.Subscription.getSubscriptions(page: 1, limit: 10, success: { (list) in
        // Successfully obtained subscription list
    }, failure: { (error) in
        // Some error occured
    })

##### Notification

Notification service has three methods:

    public static func subscribe(onStatusChanged: @escaping ( _status: InPlayerNotificationStatus) -> Void,       
                                 onMessageReceived: @escaping (_ notification: InPlayerNotification) -> Void, 
                                 onError: @escaping (_ error: InPlayerError) -> Void)

   and

    public static func unsubscribe()

    public static func isSubscribed() -> Bool

###### Example:
Subscribe method:

    InPlayer.Notification.subscribe(onStatusChanged: { (status) in
        // Notification status changed
    }, onMessageReceived: { (message) in
        // Because message has type which is enum containing associated value, this is one of the ways to use it.
        if case let NotificationType.accessGranted(resource) = message.type {
            // Access was granted, you can use resource
        }
    }, failure: { (error) in
        // InPlayerError containing info about what happened
    })
